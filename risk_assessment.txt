Cybersecurity Risk Assessment
Executive Summary
This report presents the findings of a cybersecurity vulnerability assessment conducted on a sample network/system. The assessment identified several vulnerabilities posing significant risks to the security and integrity of the network/system. Prioritised mitigation strategies are recommended to address these vulnerabilities effectively and enhance overall cybersecurity posture.


The purpose of this assessment is to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities within the sample network/system and propose mitigation strategies to mitigate risks effectively.

Sample Network/System:

                Internet
                      |
               [Firewall]
                      |
                 [Router]
                 /           \
[Web Server] [Database Server]
               \           /
         [Workstations]

Components:

Web Server: Hosts a company website accessible over the internet.
Database Server: Stores sensitive customer information.
Workstations: Used by employees for day-to-day operations.
Firewall: Controls traffic between the internal network and the internet.
Router: Connects the internal network to the internet.


Potential Threats and Vulnerabilities:
1. Unauthorised Access:
 - Threat: Hackers gaining unauthorised access to the network/system.
 - Vulnerabilities: Weak or default passwords, lack of multi-factor authentication, unpatched software vulnerabilities.

2. Malware Infection:
 - Threat: Malicious software infecting systems and disrupting operations.
 - Vulnerabilities: Lack of antivirus/malware protection, downloading files from untrusted sources, outdated software with known vulnerabilities.

3. Data Breach:
 - Threat: Sensitive customer information being accessed or stolen.
 - Vulnerabilities: Insufficient data encryption, weak database security measures, inadequate access controls.

4. Denial of Service (DoS) Attack:
 - Threat: Attackers overwhelming the network/system with excessive traffic, causing disruption.
 - Vulnerabilities: Lack of DoS protection mechanisms, inadequate bandwidth management, susceptibility to protocol-based attacks.

5. Insider Threats:
 - Threat: Malicious actions by employees or contractors with access to the network/system.
 - Vulnerabilities: Insufficient employee training on security best practices, lack of monitoring for unusual behaviour, inadequate access controls.

6. Physical Security Breach:
 - Threat: Unauthorised individuals gaining physical access to network/server rooms.
 - Vulnerabilities: Weak physical security measures such as unlocked doors, lack of surveillance cameras, unmonitored access logs.

Vulnerability Scanning:

I utilised Nessus for vulnerability scanning.

Process: Conduct a vulnerability scan on the network/system setup to identify potential weaknesses.

Identified Vulnerabilities:

Outdated Software:
Severity: High
Impact: Attackers could exploit known vulnerabilities in outdated software to gain unauthorised access or disrupt operations.

Weak Passwords:
Severity: Medium
Impact: Easily guessable or default passwords could be exploited by attackers to compromise user accounts or access sensitive information.

Missing Security Patches:
Severity: High
Impact: Unpatched software may contain known vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers to execute malicious code or gain unauthorised access.

Risk Analysis:

Assessment of Vulnerabilities:

Outdated Software:
Likelihood of Exploitation: High
Potential Impact: Significant, as attackers frequently target known vulnerabilities in outdated software.

Weak Passwords:
Likelihood of Exploitation: Medium
Potential Impact: Moderate, as weak passwords pose a risk of unauthorized access but may be mitigated with proper security measures.

Missing Security Patches:
Likelihood of Exploitation: High
Potential Impact: Critical, as unpatched vulnerabilities could lead to data breaches, system compromise, or service disruption.

Prioritisation:

High-Risk Vulnerabilities: Outdated software and missing security patches are prioritised due to their high severity and likelihood of exploitation.

Mitigation Strategies:
Outdated Software:
Implement a regular patch management process to ensure software updates are applied promptly.
Enable automatic updates where possible to mitigate the risk of delayed patching.
Weak Passwords:
Enforce strong password policies requiring a combination of alphanumeric characters, special symbols, and regular password changes.
Implement multi-factor authentication to add an extra layer of security.
Missing Security Patches:
Establish a dedicated team responsible for monitoring and applying security patches promptly.
Utilise vulnerability management tools to automate patch deployment and ensure comprehensive coverage.

Recommendations:
Regularly conduct vulnerability assessments to identify emerging threats.
Enhance employee training programs to promote cybersecurity awareness.
Invest in robust cybersecurity tools and technologies to strengthen defenses.

Addressing identified vulnerabilities and implementing recommended mitigation strategies is crucial for safeguarding the sample network/system against cyber threats. Continuous monitoring and proactive measures are essential to maintain a resilient cybersecurity posture.
